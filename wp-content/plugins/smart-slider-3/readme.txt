== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do I add the slider to my site? =
You can add your slider by shortcode or via the widget control panel or PHP shortcode.

= 2. Where can I reach the documentation? =
[https://smartslider3.helpscoutdocs.com/](https://smartslider3.helpscoutdocs.com/)

= 3. What should I do when I see blank area where the slider should show or the slider doesn't work? =
It means that there is a JavaScript error on your site which blocks other scripts (for example Smart Slider's scripts). You can open up the browser debugger window with F12 button and check the console if it shows error or not. If you solve these errors Smart Slider should work fine.

Usual problem is that you have the latest WordPress version, but your theme loads very old jQuery version (1.7 or older) and the WordPress admin bar throws a JavaScript error. In this case, you have to remove the old jQuery from your theme's functions.php.

If you are unable to solve these problems, feel free to [contact us!](https://smartslider3.com/help/)

= 4. What should I do when I experience any problem? =
[Contact us!](https://smartslider3.com/contact-us/support/)

= 5. Is Smart Slider 3 is totally responsive? =

= 6. Can I customize the fonts of the slider? =
Yes you can customize everything for every state. (hover, active, opened) The slider comes with Google Web Font support, allowing you to pick from over a dozen font families. To make using Google Fonts even easier, we have created a font manager interface that simplifies the process and preview it.

= 7. Can I show multiple instances of slider on one page? =
Yes you can use multiple slider widgets and slider shortcodes.

= 8. How to include a slider in a post or a page? =

= 9. How to include a slider into header.php or other PHP files? =
