  <h2>Goal/s</h2>
  <p>By developing this website for the Coffee Can café, we aim to increase 
    its customers in all its branches including attracting more immediate neighbourhood clientele.
  </p>
  <p>Such increase would be achieved by advertising events, presenting a food menu, 
    notifying of suspended coffees, and displaying the eco-friendly happy atmosphere which the café holds.</p>
    <p>A further goal is improving the local profile of the cafe beyond the community's apparent shared memory of a Convenience store.
  </p>

  <h2>Comments</h2>
<p>A Virtual Private Server (and unpopular domain name) was secured on which to host the staging and production wordpress environments.  A full VPS was preferable because the hosting environment and control-panel-only admin method offered by many hosting providers can seem a little restrictive (non-standard ports for SSH access, etc.).  The ability to gain root-level shell access to the web server was considered essential for efficient management of the project's infrastructure.  </p>
<p>All developers ran their own *AMPP stack (3 WAMPP, 1 MAMPP, 1 LAMPP), rather than utilising a virtual machine environment such as Vagrant.  Each developer managed their own *AMPP stack, thus this choice was warranted by efficient (self-)management of each developer's environment.</p>
<p>The Trello board was replaced by a GitHub Projects board when we realised it was being underutilised. GitHub Projects is a tool that was trusted and actully used, thus it was the more appropriate tool for the task.</p>
<p>Various utility scripts and resources for the development team were developed and stored in the <code>work/</code> directory of our repository.  Chief among these was <code>utilities.php</code>, which allowed individual developers to share monolithic database dumps after customising database-resident URLs to their particular environments.  In this way, we all worked on effectively, the same database.  </p>
